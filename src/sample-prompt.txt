I need to create AI Agents using Autogen framework using Python script in a single file (consider the current codebase for the suggestion of the Agents). 
Agents need to be created with their dependencies. 
Create the code the Agents and propose the System Prompts (system_message). 
Also simulate the initial "Audio file" with a conversation between Hiring Manager and HR Specialist talking about a role of Senior Cloud Solution Architect for Azure working on Innovation using on Cloud Native technologies in The Netherlands. 
Add logic to store the Job Requisition to a local file. 
Each LLM interaction must be output to the terminal like: ------------{ Step Name }--------

-> Agent 1
Agent Name: Summarization Agent
Input: Audio file
Output: Conversation Speech to Text and Summarize it focusing on the Job requirements
Depends on agent: N/A

-> Agent 2
Agent: HR Specialist Agent
Input: Summarized text with Job Requirements 
Output: Create a Job Requisition with - Technical Details, Benefits, Seniority and Salary Range. The output must be HTML format.
Depends on agent: Summarization
Additional login: chats with "External Communications Reviewer Agent" - if there are "Errors to fixed", bots need to chat with each other to fix the errors. Use the "initiate_chat" method to initiate the Chat between the "HR Specialist Agent" and "External Communications Reviewer Agent" with Max Number of Chat Interations: 4

-> Agent 3
Agent: External Communications Reviewer Agent 
Input: Job Requisition Form
Output: Validate the external communications for language errors. Also check if the logo is part of the Job Requisition. Logo is: Heineken-Logo.svg with 20pct of the size. 
        - If Ok: Create the Job Requisition Form
        - If Nok: List the errors to be fixed with ""Errors to be fixed:"" at the beginning
Depends on agent: N/A 

-> Agent 4
Agent: Workday Integrations Agent
Input: Job Requisition Form
Output: Send Job Requisitiion to Workday using API https://workday.com/api/v1/job-requisitions. Output a curl command to upload the Job requisition form.
Depends on agent: Chat between HR Specialist and External Communications Reviewer
